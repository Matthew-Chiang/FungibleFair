# Fungible Fair

A website to store Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT's) in a not so fungible way.

The easiest way to interface with the backend is through an API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). The client will deal with all authentication tokens. An insommnia project has been included for convenience.

`POST /user`

Creates a user.

`POST /user/login`

Login for a user. Returns a JWT through the Set-Cookie field

`DELETE /user/logout`

Logout for a user. Deletes the JWT stored on the browser.

### Profile Routes

`GET /profile`

Gets profile information about the current user supplied through the JWT.

### Image Routes

`POST /image`

Uploads an image.

`POST /image/bulk`

Bulk upload for images

`DELETE /image/id/:imageID`

Deletes an image by its image ID

### Image Routes (hosted links)
